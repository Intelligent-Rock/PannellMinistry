                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Minister John Pannell brings creative thinking and utilizes his pioneering vision to serve others from all walks of life. This servant mindset extends throughout God's church but also into the communities. As a visionary leader, Minister John Pannell encourages you to not lean on your own understanding but rather seek God's word and allow his precious Holy Spirit to guide you and instruct you during your journey through life.
<br>
<br>Throughout his journey, Minister Pannell has been blessed to have received teaching and spiritual guidance from an array of dynamic leaders, teachers, and preachers. He credits Western Michigan Teen Challenge under the Direction of Pastor McClain and Pastor Sam for providing a refuge that allowed him to be open to receive God's special gift, his Holy Spirit. Others that have helped in his spiritual journey, would include Minister Richard, Evangelist Bernice Perkins, Bishop Darryl Hines, Dr. Julian E. Spencer, and Minister Michael Armstrong. These are just a few of the dynamic leaders that have helped Minister Pannell through his spiritual journey.
<br>
<br>As a humble servant, Minister Pannell has served and led in a variety of church ministries which include, men's ministry, Bible study, kitchen ministry, parking lot ministry, band ministry, and Street Witnessing ministry, while practicing servitude every step of the way. This servant's mindset has given Minister Pannell the ability to flow, guide, break bread, and minister to God's people from all walks of life.
<br>
<br>Minister Pannell considers himself a backwoods preacher and teacher. This could be due to his family's humble beginnings. His Dad and mom grew up poor by societal standards, but what they didn't have in material things was more than replaced with love and a sense of family. Minister Pannell's grandmother was one of eleven kids raising the family with no indoor water and a wooden stove, with an outhouse in the hills of Bluefield, West Virginia. His Aunt Florence Brown was the preacher at the church that their family built from the ground up. There is even a picture of his Aunt Florence preaching the Gospel in the magazine "National Geographic" (July 1972 edition). It is no wonder that Minister John Pannell would have an ear for the Lord our savior's voice and heart for those that come from nothing.
<br>
<br>Minister John Pannell faithfully serves his local and global communities to lift those who are downtrodden and left behind. To this end, Minister Pannell provides piercing sermons that have led many to Jesus and allowed many to see the power of our savior manifested in healing, restoration of families, and deliverance from vices that have had people bound and unable to experience the fullness of God's love. Each year Minister Pannell helps undeserved communities through JRP Ministries, including homeless outreach, and educational and career development programs.<br><br><strong>"He redeems us from destruction and crowns us with tender mercy and loving Kindness" (Psalms 103:4)</strong><br><br><strong><br></strong><br></p>

Minister Pannell co-founded "RUDE" which stands for "Real Unity During Existence". As well, Minister Pannell was the Director of Admissions at Global University for over a decade. These experiences have given Minister Pannell a seat at the table with people from all walks of life and from all areas of the world. As a mover and shaker who is able to communicate with people from all social and economic backgrounds, Minister Pannell continues to mentor future leaders in a variety of areas.
